# Auto-HD-Additions-for-Youtube

Original Description: 
> "Auto HD &amp; Additions for Youtube :: Make YouTube browsing more convenient with useful features: Auto HD, Floating Player (PiP), Audio Equalize, Color Filter and more."

<br />Plugin was Deleted - Replaced on Chrome Extensions Store, with SponsorSkip plugin wich is Ripoff of orginal SponsorBlock plugin.
This one is much better than trash ripoff called "SponsorSkip".
